## Stack choice

## Design

### Brand Icons

I used the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) library for the brand icons.

Except for LinkedIn which didn't have a SVG version, so I used the [LinkedIn brand resources](https://brand.linkedin.com/downloads) to get the EPS version, then I used Inkscape & Ghostscript to export an SVG version in black and white.
