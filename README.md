# What's in this repository?

This repository contains the code of my own personal website.

Right now, it's build with Next.js and TailwindCSS.
It support internationalization for english and french.

## TODO & FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Things I need to do or not forget when needed.

### Packages

- [ ] search params state manager ([nuqs](https://nuqs.47ng.com/))

## Stack choice

### Internationalization (I18n)

- [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev/)

## Design

The design is inspired by the [TailwindCSS components](https://tailwindcss.com/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
Some components were also designed by using [vercel v0](https://v0.dev/).

### Brand Icons

I used the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) library for the brand icons.

Except for LinkedIn which didn't have a SVG version, so I used the [LinkedIn brand resources](https://brand.linkedin.com/downloads) to get the EPS version, then I used Inkscape & Ghostscript to export an SVG version in black and white.
